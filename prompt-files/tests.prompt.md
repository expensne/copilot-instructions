Write a set of basic unit tests for this Java Class: [abc]
Use **JUnit 5** for testing.  
Focus only on **key logic and important behavior** — do **not** add unnecessary or overly detailed tests.  
Keep the tests **minimal**, **clear**, and **readable**.  

Follow these guidelines:  
- Use **meaningful test method names** that **start with “should”**, e.g.  
  `shouldThrowExceptionWhenNoXmlFileInZip`,  
  `shouldThrowExceptionForTooManyFiles`.  
- Cover only **core functionality** (e.g., key methods, expected exceptions, or async behavior).  
- Use **AssertJ** for fluent assertions (`assertThat(...)`).  
- Include necessary imports, annotations, and minimal setup.  
- Keep tests **short and focused** on what truly matters.  
  
Note: Analyse existing tests and ensure a similar test strategy and style.
